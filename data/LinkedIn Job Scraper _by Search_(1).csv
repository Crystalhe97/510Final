Understand and advocate for our users. Work with researchers and product managers from customer discovery to detailed usability testing, always putting our users first.

Collaborate. You’ll be part of a communicative, healthy, product development family that includes products managers, engineers, researchers and other designers.
Ship. We ship. You’ll have multiple opportunities to bring the hypothetical to the actual and enjoy seeing your work in the hands of millions.

The Roku Culture

Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We’re independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. 

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

The Roku Culture

Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We’re independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. 

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

If you can bring clarity to complexity, design holistically in an immense product ecosystem, and have gone the extra mile to create delight, we want you!

You have a high tolerance for complex projects with high levels of ambiguity and you are resilient in the face of obstacles

We collaborate closely with each other and with engineering and product management to create industry-leading products that deliver value for the people who use them, and for Google’s businesses.

As an Interaction Designer, you’ll rely on user-centered design methods to craft industry-leading user experiences—from concept to execution. Like all of our UX jobs, you’ll collaborate with your design partners to leverage and evolve the Google design language to build beautiful, innovative, inspired products that people love to use.

Insurance... sounds slow, old-fashioned, and unexciting. Exactly. Insurance is broken, and it's failing fast-moving, innovative startups.

Vouch is a new, technology-first insurance company backed with $160M in funding from world-class investors. Like Stripe for payments or Brex for credit cards, Vouch is creating the go-to business insurance for high-growth companies.

We're doing this by making insurance fast, responsive, and focused on our high-growth and innovative customers. Instead of printed PDF applications and week-long waits, Vouch is building new technology to solve real problems, writing policies that actually cover relevant startup scenarios, and designing simple experiences in an otherwise frustrating industry.

Company Description

VirTra’s Mission is to save lives by developing, manufacturing and supporting the most powerful and immersive firearm training simulators, scenarios and accessories worldwide.

VirTra is a conscientious, high-growth, fast-paced judgmental use of force simulation training company specializing in military and law enforcement. VirTra helps prepare law enforcement officers for real-life incidents so they and the communities they serve can remain safe.

Each real-world judgmental use of force training simulator has surreal scenarios that provide an in-depth look into human performance.

VirTra helps prepare law enforcement officers for real-life incidents so they and the communities they serve can remain safe. Each real-world judgmental use of force training simulator has surreal scenarios that provide an in-depth look into human performance. The demands on law enforcement to make critical decisions in tense, uncertain and rapidly evolving situations require that the human performance aspect of cognitive neuroscience and human physiology are taken into account as part of the police training methodology. Research on how to best use law enforcement simulation technology is taken into account within what VirTra does. Training scenarios are filmed in superior quality and contain the full fidelity of real actors—thus eliminating ‘video game’ training. VirTra’s extensive branching options further increase the realism by allowing scenarios to unfold based on the instructor, trainee or team’s decisions.

Insurance... sounds slow, old-fashioned, and unexciting. Exactly. Insurance is broken, and it's failing fast-moving, innovative startups.

Vouch is a new, technology-first insurance company backed with $160M in funding from world-class investors. Like Stripe for payments or Brex for credit cards, Vouch is creating the go-to business insurance for high-growth companies.

We're doing this by making insurance fast, responsive, and focused on our high-growth and innovative customers. Instead of printed PDF applications and week-long waits, Vouch is building new technology to solve real problems, writing policies that actually cover relevant startup scenarios, and designing simple experiences in an otherwise frustrating industry.

        ","As a UX Designer at Data Society, you will be responsible for working directly with customers to uncover their goals and transform them into usable, accessible, highly functional and delightful interactive experiences. You will work closely with product managers and our development team to create clickable wireframes, mockups, functional requirements and finished products. You should understand basic HTML and CSS, and while coding skills are not required, you should have a good understanding of how web technologies like single page React apps, component libraries, APIs, and Databases work and how to design with them in mind.

You should be comfortable working in an agile environment, and familiar with concepts like scrums, sprints, story refinement, and demo days.


Responsibilities
Lead discovery sessions for new projects and create user stories from them.
Create UX artifacts like personas and customer journeys.
Create low-fidelity clickable wireframes, present them to customers for feedback, and test them with representative future users.
Write functional requirements from your user stories and wireframes with product managers and developers.
Create high-fidelity clickable mockups, present them to customers for feedback, and test them with representative future users.
Work closely with the development team to answer design questions and create or change designs as needed. We operate on the principle that the fastest way to solve an engineering problem is often design, and the fastest way to solve a design problem is often engineering.

Skills you bring
You are very experienced with Figma. We use it for our design work.
You have some experience in Adobe products like Illustrator and Photoshop.
You are familiar with the difference between low and high fidelity designs.
You understand usability and how to create web products that are visually appealing but also intuitive.
You have significant experience with accessibility, and how to design for it. We strive for full 508 and WCAG compliance.
You have experience in responsive design, and how to create designs that work well at any screen size.
You can communicate professionally with customers and users while gathering requirements and testing designs.
You have at minimum a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, and how they are used to turn designs into web pages and applications.
Experience with JavaScript and React are considered strong pluses. This role isn’t required to write code, but knowing how your designs will be built is always helpful, as is being able to write or edit code yourself.
You will need to be able to open Visual Studio, pull the latest code from our repo, and run it locally so you can help check how your designers were implemented. Basic familiarity with how Git and branches work is a strong plus.

A portfolio or collection of past work is expected for this position. It can be shared privately if you don’t or can't share it on a live website.

The ideal candidate for this role is located within the Continental US and able to work on EST hours. This position is able to be fully remote for the right candidate. Current salary range is $90,000-$110,000 though we are open to negotiation. This position is eligible for full benefits including health, medical, dental, short and long-term disability, and life insurance, as well as our 401k, transit subsidy, unlimited PTO, and 15 paid holidays during 2024.

Who We Are:

High quality, affordable healthcare is a basic human right and at Moxe, we are committed to making it a reality. We’re on a mission to slash billions from healthcare costs. It’s no secret that the US healthcare system is rife with inefficiencies and unnecessary costs. While the rest of us have migrated to interconnected, digital platforms, healthcare still uses paper, pdfs, snail mail and fax to transmit information.

We know there is a better way to deliver healthcare. Data exchange today consists of mailing or faxing paper files and pdf'ing endless records from existing Electronic Medical records. It can take months to process and compile those records into usable data. Our platform enables providers and health plans to exchange clinical data instantly, saving the entire system (patient to provider to plan) time and money in the process.

Who are we? We’re a steadfast team of innovators, problem-solvers, and truth-seekers, dedicated to disrupting the status quo. Got the moxie to challenge the US healthcare system? Let’s talk.

Got Moxie?

Join Moxe! We’re a fast-growing company focused on making a difference in healthcare. An equal opportunity employer, Moxe is looking for passionate, inclusive team players who like to solve problems, think outside the box, and thrive in a dynamic environment. We hire great people from diverse backgrounds, and that makes us stronger. If you share our values: integrity, transparency, respect, frankness, persistence, and unity, let’s talk.

All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment irrespective of race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

        ","WHO WE ARE




We’re a passionate team of hardworking people who enjoy what we do. At Hannon Hill, we build and support content management and digital personalization tools that make it easy for non-technical users to build sophisticated websites that deliver powerful user experiences. 




Our flagship product, Cascade CMS, empowers users to create, edit, and share digital content across sites and channels. Clive is an engagement and real-time personalization tool for collecting visitor attributes and delivering relevant content.




We’re on strong financial footing with over 21 years of organic growth, and continue to maintain our reputation as the #1 commercial content management system for higher education.




POSITION SUMMARY

You’ll work primarily on the web interfaces of our core products—Cascade CMS and Clive—as well as any new products we create. Clive’s user interface is based on a component design system built in React and maintained in Figma. Cascade CMS’s design is more ad-hoc though we’re moving towards more component-based design everywhere. We have the beginnings of a Design System already in place in Figma.




We work in 6-8 week product cycles and often release new functionality weekly for both products. During a cycle, you might be working on 3-4 different projects with different members of the Product team with additional reviews of others’ work throughout.




Here are some projects we’ve worked on recently:

Redesigned a Form builder in our product, Clive, that allows users to create and publish their own web forms from a selection of fields, and reorder and customize them.
Built a new report in Cascade CMS that allows users to see summaries of in-progress and completed Workflows in the product and take action directly from the report.
Assessed our products for WCAG 2 AA accessibility and made changes to visual components to make them more accessible.
Designed an Integrations interface to allow our product Clive to connect with third-party systems and create data mapping between them.
Prototyped many new features as clickable prototypes to solicit feedback from stakeholders and customers before building them. Sometimes a simple pen and paper sketch will be enough. And sometimes a more high-fidelity design will be needed.




ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES

Work daily with Engineers to conceptualize, design, and build product experiences.
Create Designs of different fidelities for different needs. 
Maintain and improve an existing Design System managed in Figma to create consistent product experiences and brand identity across products
Conduct design and UX reviews of work by Engineers, Product team members and other Designers
Work closely with UX-focused Engineers on large-scale improvements to product UX over time
Apply the “Jobs to be Done” product philosophy to help us identify customers’ core needs and devise solutions in collaboration with the Product team.
Conduct user research and tests to help identify new opportunities and the best solution to customer needs.
Brainstorm ideas for design-led product functionality and other business initiatives.
Follow industry trends and best practices in Product design and apply them where appropriate.
Provide Design support to other departments. This will include creating compelling visuals for presentations and proposals and improving the design of our own web properties.
Write microcopy for our products, write project comments and project proposals designed to persuade team members to adopt ideas, and write design critiques of people’s work.




KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL

Excellent written communication skills across a variety of mediums and contexts (Slack, Github, and Figma) are required. 
Ability to work asynchronously while maintaining team productivity. 
Comfortable writing basic HTML/CSS (and perhaps some Javascript!). 
Excellent reading comprehension across a variety of different mediums.
Ability to keep up with multiple conversation threads in Slack, email, Github, and Figma and respond in a timely manner. 
Prior experience building or working in a component-based Design System is preferred.
Experience with user research and testing methods and product discovery processes are a plus.




PHYSICAL DEMANDS

Sitting for long periods of time
Frequent use of computers and standard office equipment
Lift and/or carry up to 30 pounds




WORK ENVIRONMENT




This job operates in a casual, but professional hybrid office environment. This position frequently utilizes standard office equipment such as computers, phones, printers, and scanners.

We collaborate closely with each other and with engineering and product management to create industry-leading products that deliver value for the people who use them, and for Google’s businesses.

As an Interaction Designer, you’ll rely on user-centered design methods to craft industry-leading user experiences—from concept to execution. Like all of our UX jobs, you’ll collaborate with your design partners to leverage and evolve the Google design language to build beautiful, innovative, inspired products that people love to use.

        ","Here at Spellbrush, we're passionate about making a good anime game.

We also happen to be the world's leading generative AI studio — we're the team behind niji・journey.

We are currently investigating how AI can be used to help human artists perform masterpieces in the most complex medium of our times: videogames.

Our games are characterized by a no-compromise approach to well-balanced gameplay married to a truthful love of visual arts.

If you love turn-based tactics games, please consider applying!

The Role:

Spellbrush, the world’s leading generative AI studio behind niji・journey, is looking for a UI/UX Designer to bring our mobile turn-based tactics game to life with distinctive flair! If you love games like Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics and are eager to help waifus and husbandos look their sharpest, hit us up!

What you’ll do:


Design and mock up the user interfaces of our games in your favorite design tool (figma, photoshop, origami studio, etc.), ensuring that they are visually appealing and easy to use.
Collaborate with game designers, artists, and developers to define and refine the game's user interface and user experience
Develop reusable UI components and libraries for use across multiple games and projects.


You might be a great fit if:


You love the art of user interfaces. We’re looking for someone with ideally 3+ years of mobile game UI / UX experience, who is as comfortable with designing high-tech futuristic interfaces as they are minimalistic app designs.Our games boast unique gameplay mechanics with varying graphic / VFX assets, so the ability to envision and implement cohesive experiences is a must.
Your user empathy blossoms in both the stylistic and the functional. If your goal as a designer is to create one of the most iconic but intuitive menu experiences in the mobile game industry, then Spellbrush is the right company to join! We pride our exploration of aesthetics while maintaining a high standard for usability.
The anime aesthetic resonates with you. It's no secret – we're huge anime enthusiasts. A deep understanding of audiences who enjoy anime, mobile gacha games, and turn-based tactics games is critical to build the optimal designs for our audiences.
You're comfortable working on small, fast-paced, on-site teams Working here will feel very much like a small indie studio: close-knit, with high ownership and flexibility. We’re also an in-person studio. Our games team is at our office in downtown San Francisco, CA, 3-4x a week!
And you're excited about the potential of Generative AI. You'll also be working closely with some of the best AI researchers in the world: we develop all our own in-house models. You won’t be using Generative AI simply as a vehicle for producing cheap assets. (We simply don’t believe that is an effective workflow). You’ll be working with the research team to explore the frontier of what is possible at the intersection of machine learning, art, and games.


The base salary range for this position is $60,000 - $140,000. The final base salary is dependent upon location, experience, fit, and other factors. In addition, we offer a generous compensation package that includes equity, top-tier employer-sponsored health, dental, and vision insurance, and additional perks!

At Spellbrush, we value creativity, collaboration, and innovation. If you're excited about working with cutting-edge technology and passionate about anime, gaming, and design, we'd love to hear from you. Apply now to join our team as a Game UI / UX Designer!

To apply - please share your previous work experience/resume, portfolio, and any links to previous relevant works and the name of the best waifu or husbando in your message!

          Must haves: 1. User Research: User experience designers should have a strong foundation in user research methodologies.

        ","Here at Spellbrush, we're passionate about making a good anime game.

We also happen to be the world's leading generative AI studio — we're the team behind niji・journey.

We are currently investigating how AI can be used to help human artists perform masterpieces in the most complex medium of our times: videogames.

Our games are characterized by a no-compromise approach to well-balanced gameplay married to a truthful love of visual arts.

If you love turn-based tactics games, please consider applying!

The Role:

Spellbrush, the world’s leading generative AI studio behind niji・journey, is looking for a UI/UX Designer to bring our mobile turn-based tactics game to life with distinctive flair! If you love games like Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics and are eager to help waifus and husbandos look their sharpest, hit us up!

What you’ll do:


Design and mock up the user interfaces of our games in your favorite design tool (figma, photoshop, origami studio, etc.), ensuring that they are visually appealing and easy to use.
Collaborate with game designers, artists, and developers to define and refine the game's user interface and user experience
Develop reusable UI components and libraries for use across multiple games and projects.


You might be a great fit if:


You love the art of user interfaces. We’re looking for someone with ideally 3+ years of mobile game UI / UX experience, who is as comfortable with designing high-tech futuristic interfaces as they are minimalistic app designs.Our games boast unique gameplay mechanics with varying graphic / VFX assets, so the ability to envision and implement cohesive experiences is a must.
Your user empathy blossoms in both the stylistic and the functional. If your goal as a designer is to create one of the most iconic but intuitive menu experiences in the mobile game industry, then Spellbrush is the right company to join! We pride our exploration of aesthetics while maintaining a high standard for usability.
The anime aesthetic resonates with you. It's no secret – we're huge anime enthusiasts. A deep understanding of audiences who enjoy anime, mobile gacha games, and turn-based tactics games is critical to build the optimal designs for our audiences.
You're comfortable working on small, fast-paced, on-site teams Working here will feel very much like a small indie studio: close-knit, with high ownership and flexibility. We’re also an in-person studio. Our games team is at our office in downtown San Francisco, CA, 3-4x a week!
And you're excited about the potential of Generative AI. You'll also be working closely with some of the best AI researchers in the world: we develop all our own in-house models. You won’t be using Generative AI simply as a vehicle for producing cheap assets. (We simply don’t believe that is an effective workflow). You’ll be working with the research team to explore the frontier of what is possible at the intersection of machine learning, art, and games.


The base salary range for this position is $60,000 - $140,000. The final base salary is dependent upon location, experience, fit, and other factors. In addition, we offer a generous compensation package that includes equity, top-tier employer-sponsored health, dental, and vision insurance, and additional perks!

At Spellbrush, we value creativity, collaboration, and innovation. If you're excited about working with cutting-edge technology and passionate about anime, gaming, and design, we'd love to hear from you. Apply now to join our team as a Game UI / UX Designer!

        ","What To Expect
Tesla is re-thinking how batteries are made from the ground up. We’re designing new factories, new equipment, new processes, and new software to rapidly scale battery manufacturing, globally. The primary bottleneck to Tesla’s future expansion (and the transition to sustainable transport and energy storage) is our ability to produce and procure batteries – that’s why we’re innovating in-house, with our collection of world-class engineers, to redefine the industry. Software, data, and automation all play a huge part in this strategy.

We’ve built software from scratch with a nimble and high performing team to meet the specific needs of Tesla’s rapid battery manufacturing scale up.

This platform is the conduit for data coming from the line, and it is part of the goal to have more data about battery manufacturing, end to end, than any other company.

The Cell Software team is responsible for building software solutions that allow the company to redefine manufacturing and production. Our software enables users to virtually control the manufacturing process and machines, interact with and track the flow of production material, and get quick and powerful insights about the line. Our UI is the place to get quick feedback about the state of material, investigate irregularities, and set line configurations.

We’re looking for a UX Designer to build out the interfaces and tools that engineers (Process, Quality, Controls, Manufacturing), managers, and thousands of operators interact with daily, at factories around the world. Your goal will be to deeply understand the users, processes, and integrations of Software in Tesla’s 4680 Cell Manufacturing line. Then leverage that context to partner with software engineers and product managers in ideating and designing intuitive interfaces.

You will lead the design decisions across our portfolio of Cell Software products. Leveraging and building upon Tesla’s existing Design System. Owning solutions end-to-end -- from customer research, through to design, rollout, and customer feedback.

The ideal candidate is excited to by the ability to go and talk to your users directly, deep dive into manufacturing, thrives in multi-disciplinary environments, is comfortable understanding software systems, has a high sense of ownership, and has a bias for action.

What You'll Do


Build up a deep understanding of the users, their needs, and how they interface with the systems. Through user research and spending time on the manufacturing line
Collaborate and ideate with engineering and product teams on new products, features, and improvements
Translate user, problem space, product insights into user flows, profiles, mockups and designs
Drive a consistent design language that translates across web, mobile, and machine interfaces
Come up with creative ways to intuitively visualize and abstract the complexities of complex manufacturing processes and sophisticated software systems
Become the trusted advocate and champion for the user perspective
Example projects include building a tool to visualize all the materials that end up in a finished cell and how they got put together. Designing a recipe and process management platform that allows engineers to control what the machines are doing and defining each step of the manufacturing process. Mobile interface to identify and investigate issues with material on the line



What You'll Bring


Portfolio samples that demonstrate an ability to turn technically complex problems into elegant and empathetic solutions that reduce cognitive load on end users
Demonstrated experience with complex software systems or other technical/engineering context
Organized and effective at documentation to drive alignment across team and stakeholders

About The Job

At Google, we follow a simple but vital premise: ""Focus on the user and all else will follow."" User Experience Researchers (UXRs) make this possible.

Google User Experience (UX) is made up of multi-disciplinary teams of UX Designers, Researchers, Writers, Content Strategists, Program Managers, and Engineers: we care deeply about the people who use our products. The UX team plays an integral part in gathering insights about the needs, attitudes, emotions, and behaviors of people who use our products to inspire and inform design. We collaborate closely with each other and with engineering and product management to create industry-leading products that deliver value for the people who use them, and for Google’s businesses.

Where we Work

OneTrust embraces a hybrid working model. Our Working@ OneTrust initiative is our way of clarifying where we hire, how we work together, and where we’re located in that hybrid model.

The underlying “why” for Working@ is that we are intentional about the culture that we want to create together. That includes bringing teams together, in-person, throughout the year to collaborate, build connections, learn from each other, and celebrate our wins to Finish Stronger.

We are committed to a flexible approach informed by a set of guiding principles. You’ll see that reflected in our worker designations: “Office-flex” and “Location-flex”.


Office-flex: Like a traditional hybrid model, OneTrust “Office-flex” employees may be asked to work in an office periodically if they are within a commutable distance to a OneTrust office. This includes coming into the office for our Company Kickoff, Company All Hands, and other larger company events. Beyond that, we give our leaders and teams the flexibility to set additional guidelines based on the nature of your role.
Location-flex: Similar to other companies’ remote policies, for OneTrust “Location-flex"" roles, you will primarily work from your home office location. However, you may be required to travel to our OneTrust offices or customer sites periodically based on the nature of your role.


Each role may have specific requirements, so we encourage you to verify the location of the role with your recruiter during your first interview.

Benefits

As an employee at OneTrust, you will be part of the OneTeam. That means you’ll receive support physically, mentally, and emotionally so that you can do your best work both in and out of the office. This includes comprehensive healthcare coverage, flexible PTO, equity stock options, annual performance bonus opportunities, retirement account support, 14+ weeks of paid parental leave, career development opportunities, company-paid privacy certification exam fees, and much more. Specific benefits differ by country. For more information, talk to your recruiter or visit onetrust.com/careers.

About Rewiring America

Rewiring America is the leading electrification nonprofit, focused on electrifying our homes, businesses, and communities. We develop accessible, actionable data and tools, and build coalitions and partnerships to make going electric easier for households and communities. Rewiring America helps Americans save money, tackle nationwide emissions goals, improve health, and build the next generation of the clean energy workforce. We believe in an abundant, flourishing, climate-safe future, and know that, together, we can realize one.

Position Summary

We are growing our team and seeking an entrepreneurial and multidisciplinary designer who will work with our Rewiring Communities team to design an experience from scratch to support electrification projects for homeowners in low income and historically disadvantaged communities. This is a unique and important opportunity to build products and services that ensure that the electrification transition happens equitably. This position reports to the Head of Product.

What You’ll Do

You will work closely with a cross-functional team at Rewiring America that is engaging directly with communities on the ground to understand the barriers that households face and to design products and services that can overcome these barriers at scale. These solutions will need to be deeply grounded in knowledge of homeowners and communities, and will likely require multiple rounds of prototyping and iteration to get right. The end goal is to craft products and services that can facilitate bringing financial resources into these communities and support electrification that can scale to historically disadvantaged communities across the country. This will require a wide variety of work, from user research and discovery to prototyping to product strategy to perhaps some front-end development for the right candidate.

You will:


Conduct user discovery and research, synthesize your learnings and codify them into key insights, personas, and journeys - which make you a strong champion for the user experience in all aspects of the program
Collaborate and consult with many cross-functional stakeholders to align on the timeline, goals, outputs of the work, as well as the broader program design that the products and services fit into
Develop early-stage concepts and prototypes for internal and external testing and many rounds of iteration
Facilitate design-thinking exercises, workshops, and sprints with your team to advance new ideas
Wear the product manager “hat” for this early-stage effort by writing briefs and strategy docs, aligning on priorities, and teeing up key build vs. buy decisions for key elements of the experience
Stay connected to the core Rewiring America engineering, product, and design team to share insights and borrow foundations (e.g. our nascent design system) to help accelerate the work.
Step into whatever is needed to get the job done - this is a highly independent and entrepreneurial role!

        ","Peer Insight is looking for a passionate and motivated User Researcher to join us in the new business building work we do. Our firm’s mission is to serve the growth ambitions of established organizations and their (current and/or future) stakeholders with new value-generating products and services beyond their core businesses. This is all about getting into the market to experiment, iterate, and validate solutions to real customer problems.

More About Us

Peer Insight is a business-builder. Since 2012, we have collaborated on more than 75 innovation projects with Global 2000 companies and not-for-profits. In the process, we have been part of launching more than a dozen multimillion-dollar businesses. Our core ingredients, and what gets our team excited each day, are a powerful blend of entrepreneurship, corporate innovation, and human-centered design (HCD). Our firm offers the chance to work on multiple corporate- sponsored start-ups in an incubator environment with an incredible team. Our team comes from different backgrounds, but we are united by our mission and our Guiding Principles. We thrive on radical transparency, embrace the power of small teams, practice rigorous experimentation, and assume positive intent and generous collaboration.

Each project is staffed with one of our Partners, a Venture Lead, and two or more User Researchers and Product Strategists, with additional support from the broader team. This is a hands-on role, where you will roll up your sleeves and practice deep collaboration – in the market, with users, with colleagues and with client-partners.

THE ROLE OF A USER RESEARCHER

Our human-centered design orientation applies inside the firm as well as out, so we are obsessed with finding and supporting the highest-quality talent for all of our work. This role is critical to the success of our projects and to the firm at large, so we’re hyper-focused on creating success in every direction.

Regardless of the phase of a project, User Researcher is a highly engaged, collaborative role, where you will both lead and support the design, execution and analysis of a huge variety of market research and live experimentation – from desk research to interviews and ethnography, to ads and landing pages tests, to medium to high fidelity functional prototypes (and much much more; hopefully you’ll teach us some new techniques too).

We are targeting an early 2024 start date but are flexible.

Key Responsibilities


Design and execute primary and secondary research – identifying and prioritizing assumptions and defining a path to test them through user research and in-market experimentation
Support and/or drive the early development of a new solution – identifying target users, defining key features, designing business models, managing prototype builds, and crafting go-to-market strategies
Contribute to a practical plan for de-risking an opportunity – helping discern how best to deploy the limited resources (team and budget) available and then iterating that plan as we learn more from the market
Ruthlessly prioritize and iterate (approach and/or solution) based on feedback from users
Support communicating to key stakeholders in the process of venture building – conceptualize and oversee the delivery of assets and artifacts that bring a diverse group of stakeholders along for continued investment decisions


Requirements

WHAT WE’RE LOOKING FOR


4+ years relevant experience across a combination of the following areas:
research and human-centered design
innovation/design consulting
product strategy or product design / early prototyping
corporate innovation strategy
Well-versed in applying human-centered design principles to the research, development, and execution of new products and services
Experience with activating and contributing to teams in dynamic (virtual and live) environments
Comfort and courage with navigating the unknown through rigorous testing and iteration – we like to say, “You don’t know, but you know how to know”
Ability to handle complexity – weighing a variety of competing factors to make sound decisions with imperfect and/or incomplete data
We strive to recruit a group of unique individuals, but our team members tend to share these attributes: Curiosity | Perceptiveness | Optimism | Courage | Entrepreneurialism | Discernment | Humility


What You Will Need


You lead with genuine empathy – it’s not your ideas that drive you, it’s their problems
You inspire people to work with you – you’re a top-notch collaborator
You have a strong sense of ownership – you’re willing to do whatever it takes to serve the mission, the team and the customer
You are focused on results and appreciate the entrepreneurial constraints of limited resources
You respond well to complex situations, working with customers and partners to solve problems
You move quickly and have the confidence to act decisively when needed
You know what to measure, when, and how to communicate success/learnings to others who have not been in the trenches with you
You have the ability to work with remote teams
You appreciate the power of a diverse organization and contribute to the culture of co-creating impactful solutions
You know that these problems require teams to solve them – there is no one right answer, and one brilliant brain is not enough to solve any of the problems we work on


Benefits

HOW YOU’LL GROW

We’ve found new members of our team grow quickly because of the varied and complex challenges we solve together. You’ll hone your problem solving toolkit by applying it across industries and within every phase of the innovation cycle – from opportunity discovery to needs finding, through product design, iteration and in-market pilot tests. We want every team member to grow at the pace that is comfortable to them, and as such the firm tends to promote on the spot as we observe individuals contributing at a higher level, rather than waiting for a development cycle to come back around. A researcher can grow from being an outstanding contributor, to being a leader of a project/venture, to owning greater client responsibility and/or internal responsibility. Every role at Peer Insight is hands-on and in contact with the work – even our partners are deeply embedded into project delivery – which allows us to be inspired by and to learn from one another each and every day.

        ","About Us:

At CoApp Technologies, we're at the forefront of pioneering innovations for web-based point of sale (POS) and line of business applications with our cutting-edge B2B SaaS product. Our unique approach doesn't seek to replace existing POS systems. Instead, we leverage our cloud-based platform and browser extension to create a seamless, client-side integration that enhances productivity and reduces errors. This integration strategy ensures that every user interaction becomes deeply integrated with their business processes, elevating the overall efficiency.

Born from the Dr. Tavel Family Eyecare legacy—a 24-location optometry practice thriving for over 80 years—CoApp is not just another startup. Backed by decades of industry experience and millions in funding, we are a pre-revenue venture on the brink of transforming the optometry sector and beyond. Our driven team includes CEO Kent, Customer Success Leader Kyle, Software Engineering Leader Jackie, and Software Engineer Jack, all dedicated to steering our product from a promising beta to a market-leading solution.

As we prepare to spin off from Dr. Tavel and emerge as an independent, fast-growing SaaS company, we're on the lookout for a UI/UX Designer & Product Roadmap Leader. This new team member will play a pivotal role in refining our product into a robust, scalable solution that not only meets but exceeds the expectations of our users in the optometry field and expands into new markets.

The Role:

As a UI/UX Designer & Product Roadmap Leader, you will be the heartbeat of our product development process. Your role is twofold: to design intuitive, functional UI/UX elements that enhance user satisfaction and to manage the product roadmap to ensure our solution, not only meets but exceeds market needs. This position is unique, requiring a blend of creative design skills, deep product insight, and methodical project management. You will be expected to:


Become a master user of our product and the product (Acuity Logic) it integrates with, deeply understanding its capabilities and the problems it solves
Drive the design process from insight to execution, using tools like Figma (open to others) to create designs that are both innovative and intuitive
Build and maintain the product roadmap outlining major features and functionality that need to be added to the product
Implement and manage a robust system for road mapping, documentation, and execution within our Jira platform, ensuring that the Head of Engineering can seamlessly translate your roadmap items and designs into epics, user stories, and tasks for our agile sprints
Act as the keeper of prioritization, guiding the organization to focus on features and improvements that deliver maximum value
Collaborate closely with our sister company, Dr. Tavel, and directly engage with customers alongside our CEO and head of customer success to gather feedback and identify new opportunities for enhancement



Requirements


A creative and thoughtful designer who is passionate about creating delightful, powerful, and functional user experiences
Significant experience with Figma or related tools
Someone who lives, eats, sleeps, and dreams about our product, always thinking about how to improve it and make it more valuable to our users
An individual who is curious, organized, and has a knack for ideation and articulating complex ideas to both internal and external stakeholders
Experience in designing B2B SaaS apps is a plus, but not required. More importantly, we are looking for someone hungry, intensely curious, and innovative, regardless of their level of experience
Strong communication skills and the ability to work closely with technical and non-technical team members
A portfolio showcasing web/software design work, demonstrating an ability to think outside the box and deliver solutions that are not only functional but aesthetically pleasing
Experience in a SaaS startup is a plus

About LITIGIVEN

At LITIGIVEN, we are revolutionizing the world of legal finance by leveraging cutting-edge security and smart litigation finance markets supported by predictive artificial intelligence.

In today’s legal environment, obtaining litigation financing is crucial for plaintiffs and law firms. However, this market is often exclusive and expensive.

We have identified this challenge and developed a game-changing solution. Our predictive legal AI significantly reduces human labor costs, making it easier for clients to obtain litigation financing. We have even patented the first AI-Pilot case law citation database in the U.S., providing precise analysis for our predictive AI and greatly reducing the cost of case risk analysis.

Our mission is to democratize litigation financing, making it affordable for a broader range of clients. We are committed to creating a frictionless platform that connects plaintiffs, law firms, and litigation financiers. By sharing insights, speeding up the financing process, and reducing risk and costs, our goal is to transform the way legal financing works.

        ","In the last 50 years, home sizes in the US have nearly doubled, yet the housing supply is growing at half the pace that it was 50 years ago. This has caused housing prices and rent to skyrocket. At the same time, isolation is now considered America’s most significant health risk.

CoLife aims to solve both by making coliving safe, easy, and affordable. We match homeowners with live-in renters based on mutual values and interests. CoLife enables homeowners to offer renters a home on average 50-60% lower than the market rate and helps solve isolation by bringing people together.

CoLife has recently closed its pre-seed round and joined a San Francisco-based venture studio founded by an ex-Sequoia partner who has invested in six unicorns and is led by one of the founders of one of those unicorns, in addition to Alpaca VC (Sandbox, Classpass, Compass) and Social Leverage VC (Robinhood, Wag, Airtable).

As a rapidly growing startup, we prioritize a user-centric approach and believe a strong UX is fundamental to our success. Join us in shaping the future of housing and human connection and make an impact from day one.
